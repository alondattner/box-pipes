# BoxPipes
Inspired by the classic "3D Pipes" screensaver for Windows, this project recreates the visuals in a modern web environment using JavaScript. It uses the p5.js library to create a dynamic 3D scene featuring colorful pipes and moving stars. This project was created as part of a p5 course for my master's degree in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), with a focus on giving the screensaver a more pixelated style.
